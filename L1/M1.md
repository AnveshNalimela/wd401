# Scenario: Navigating Pull-Request Challenges in Your First Development Task

Congratulations on landing your first job as a Software Developer! You've joined a dynamic team where collaborative development is key, and the workflow heavily relies on pull-requests. Let's delve into a work-specific scenario based on the lessons we have covered.


You're assigned to a project that involves implementing a critical feature using a branching strategy inspired by GitFlow. Each developer creates feature branches, works on their assigned tasks, and then submits pull-requests for code review.

# Problem Statement:
You've been assigned to a project that involves enhancing a critical feature for a web application. The team places a strong emphasis on the pull-request workflow, with a focus on code reviews, merge conflict resolution, and the recent integration of CI/CD. As you navigate through the development task, you encounter challenges such as feedback during code reviews and discussions on effective merge conflict resolution. The team looks to you to demonstrate your understanding of these challenges and your ability to adapt to the added complexity of CI/CD integration.

# Handling Code Review Feedback:

1.I made some changes based on feedback provided during the code review process Basically it important to understand the feedback througlhy before start making changes. 2. First need to understand the feedback in case of any problem while understanding have a discussion with the reviewer for better insights and conclusions 3.After having complete understanding regarding the problem then start finding those mentioned points in the code base and try sloving them.

Have a look at my code review provided in below. 1.There are list of match which are based on prefernced sports only Based on the feedback provided i changed it logic behind it and Updated the code accordingly Now the match list is compltely based on both teams and sports selected by user.

2.Second point of feedback suggested to filter based on both teams and sports. Later i made changes which allow user to filter based on both teams and sports which was early only based on sports only.

# Iterative Development Process
Iterative development is a process that involves continuously improving a feature through repeated cycles of planning, development, testing, and feedback

## 
- Code 
- Review
- Feedback
- Refactor

## Steps invloved in Iterative Development

- Start
  
- Identify Feature to Develop
 
- Plan and Design
  
- Develop Initial Version
 
- Test Initial Version
  
- Deploy Initial Version to Users
  
- Collect User Feedback
  
- Analyze Feedback
  
- Identify Areas for Improvement
  
- Plan and Design Improvements

- Develop Improved Version

- Test Improved Version
  
- Deploy Improved Version to Users
 
- Collect User Feedback (Loop back to "Analyze Feedback" step)
  
- Repeat Iterative Cycle Until Satisfied
  
- Final Deployment

- End


## Resolving Merge Conflicts:
## Scenario:
Consider a scenario where application have landing page which allow user to enter the email address Here Based on email address provided it should redirected to two different pages.consider a signup for new user and sigin for already existing user In such cases where one feature in developed on branch signin and other feature developed on branch signup there exists a merge conflict between this two branchs. 

## Solution 

# Solution

## Fetch Latest Changes from the Main Branch: 
Use the following commands for that git fetch origin git checkout main git pull origin main

```bash
  git fetch origin
```


```bash
  git checkout main
```


```bash
  git pull origin main
```

## Switch to branch where conflict arises

Here signin feature branch and  command:

```bash
  git checkout feature/signin
```
## Merge the main branch into signin feature branch 
command:

```bash
  git merge origin/main
```
## Identify and reslove the conflict 
Let consider users list of emails then use these logic 

```bash
  if(email in users)
  { 
  //signin logic here
  } 
  else
  {
   //signup logic here
  }
```

## Add the resloved files to git 
command:

```bash
  git add fileName
```

## commit the merge 
Command:
 
 ```bash
  git commit -m "commit message" 
```
## push the changes 
Commad: 

 ```bash
  git push 
```

# CI/CD Integration 
 To ensure that the code aligns with CI/CD requirements, we need to integrate automated tests, quality checks, and proper build and deployment configurations. Consider the code snippet provided which is part of app.js in LMS capstone it is used change the password to ensure that it works as expected we wrote an test case in test suite using the jest framework which will ensure that the feature works as expected in real-wolrd circumstances

we have been using the eslint and prettier for better code quality
