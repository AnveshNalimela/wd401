## Use your familiarity with your web application to determine where the addition of AI could have a positive impact.
The web application which are developed now-a-days mainly focuses on user experinces.
Applications which provides the better user experices stand out now-a-days. Making the application peronalize for each user is hectic task but Generative AI addition into the web applicatipn makes them provides better peronazlied user experinces.AI helps to provide the person specific content based on prefernces and past inputs from the user. The Addition of AI into web application makes a positive impact would make the user experices better and provide assiatnce to user through chatbots and recomendations.
The addition of AI into web application would enhance personalization of users based on their prefernces through natuarl language processing.
And Also most of web application had issue of repetitive tasks like  data entry, form filling, and customer support . AI would able automate this repetitive tasks by using the chatbots
Enhanced User Experience is achieved by addition of AI
Content Generation can be done using AI tools which would ease the process of content creation.
Tell talk in context of My application sportbuzz  which is designed for sports enthusiasts to provide real-time match scores and up-to-date sports news articles. Intergation of AI into application would be make the tasks like summarize the article story automate rather than reading entire article.
Prefernces of user can changed by instructiong the AI through text or voice input.
here are several areas where the integration of AI could significantly enhance user experience and add value


## If you decide to experiment with integrating Generative AI features, report on any technical, practical, or conceptual challenges you faced.
I Wanted to experiment with integarting Generative AI features into my sportbuzz application  which is designed for sports enthusiasts to provide real-time match scores and up-to-date sports news articles.
But there are many chanllenges First of all the finding the generative model which is open-source and free to use.
Securing the API keys in the codebase and integrating with model through API is really challenging.
Intergating the model into the application using the API keys and testing whether the model is responding to our input from the application then  we need to create the UI in application for interacting with AI tool from client side. 
Now the model would able to recieve the prompts and respond to prompts. But we need to make the reponse more specific in context of application for that we need to add additional configuation to model to reposnd in context of application.
After the configuring the model accordingly the application later the model is responding accordingly .But we cannot expect the user to give the valid or no-ambigious input so we need to prepocess the data before passing the prompt to model and if the input is unclear the make the model to ask for clarifications
Now the model is ready to recieve the input and reponds as accordingly
Inorder to enhnace the user experice we need to add additional features to model to perform some tasks through prompts.So we need to make the model to perform some kind of opertion.In my case summarize the articles or updating the preferncens of user trhrough text prompt.
we need to access the data regaring the articles from state and pass it to model and then summarize the entire article and responding with summarized text is huge task for me.
